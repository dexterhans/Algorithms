DFS:

step 1: insert the starting vertex into stack, then pop it out and set the boole	-an variable corresponding to it to false and push all the connected
	nodes into the stack.
step 2: if we encounter a node which is already inside the stack insert it again 	as it would make a difference in the execution order. if the node is 		already deleted ignore it and proceed.

	in implementation set the visited array to false after deletion.

BFS:

step 1:insert the starting vertex into the queue and pop and continue by 		inserting the attached vertex, so on until all queue is empty.
step 2:if the element appears again which is already in the queue we need not in	sert again as it would not matter.
	
	in the implementation set the visited aray to false after inserting in t	he queue.
